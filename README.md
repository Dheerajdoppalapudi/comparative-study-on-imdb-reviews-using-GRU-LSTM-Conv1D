# comparative-study-on-imdb-reviews-using-GRU-LSTM-Conv1D

This is a comparaive study in IMDB data set using GRU(Gated recurrent units), LSTM(long short-term memory) and 1D convolution layer.

# GRU
--> GRU and LSTM are very similar they also produce similar results GRU's can be considered as the simpler version of LSTM
